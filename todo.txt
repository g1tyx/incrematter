Version 0.0.1 [Initialization] - COMPLETED
Stuff to do for this version:
    1. Update all generator values with variables in main.js.                                           !
    2. Add a number formatting system (up to 1e15).                                                     !
    3. Add the main production loop.                                                                    !
    4. Make buttons red when unbuyable and green when buyable, always black text on white when hovered. !
    5. Make the generator "per second percentages" work.                                                !
    6. Add formula for generator efficiency (every 10 purchases of said generator).                     !
    7. Make generators gradually show up by using their initial costs.                                  !
    8. Make generators increase price (every 10 purchases of said generator).                           !
    9. Add text that shows you when the next generator is going to be visible.                          !
    10. Create the different tabs, with just some placeholder text.                                     !

The basics are all done!

Version 0.0.2 [Second Initialization]
Stuff to do for this version:
    1. Add best matter, total matter and spent matter in the statistics tab.                            !
    2. Add exporting and importing in the options tab.                                                  !
    3. Add the first micro-prestige layer: booster.                                                     !
    This gives a boost to all of the generators at the cost of resetting the game from the start.
    Formula for the multiplier is (matter/1e4)^(1/30) (the 30th root of matter divided by 10,000).      
    4. Make it so the generator "per second percentages" only show up when the next one is visible.     !
    5. Upload the game on GitHub and add a website for it too so the game goes semi-public.             ?
    6. Add offsite-links (changelog, how to play and credits).                                          ?

Version 0.0.3 [Getting There]
