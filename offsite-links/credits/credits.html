		<br>
		<p class="crt">This game was inspired by various incremental game developers, such as Hevipelle, dan-simon, etc. and games like <a href="https://ivark.github.io/">Antimatter Dimensions</a> and <a href="https://dan-simon.github.io/misc/fe000000/">FE000000</a>.</p>
		<p class="crt">This game uses ExpantaNum.js (there's no need for this honestly) created by Naruyoko. This library allows for numbers much, much bigger than the standard JavaScript limit (>>> 1.78e308).</p>
		<br>
		<p class="crt">Everything else in this game is made by me.</p>
